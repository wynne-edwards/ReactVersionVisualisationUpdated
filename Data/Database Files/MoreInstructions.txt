Most of this is covered in the Read Me on GitHub, however more directions can never hurt.

The instructions use pgAdmin 4 to restore a backup of the database (the backup is the file found in the Database Files folder, same as this document).


Step 1.
Create a pgAdmin connection, I left mine as default in the code (username: postgres ; password: postgres). If you change yours, please can you adjust the parameters for connection as found at the top of the server.py file.

Step 2. 
Create a database. The code in server.py has the name set as DemoData so for a seemless install do the same.

Step 3. 
Right click on the database you have created and click restore. Locate the file (Note: On windows it sets the visible files to a .backup file type. However the actual backup is a tar file and wont be visible, so, to view the file in your explorer please click on the dropdown and select All Files) Select the file and click restore.

Step 4. Once you have clicked restore, you should have a running database of my instance. For any configuration differences from the following options will require you to adjust the server.py file.

database_config = {
    'dbname': 'DemoData',
    'user': 'postgres',
    'password': 'postgres',
    'host': '127.0.0.1',  # or your server's IP address
    'port': '5432'  # default PostgreSQL port
}
